Peace be upon you, heroes!
How are you all doing? I hope everything’s good 💜

In shaa’ Allah this is our first assignment 🤩 (you’ll find the design image at the last link).

✅ We need to recreate this exact design using only the tags we learned in the lecture (meaning pure HTML, no CSS).
✅ Choose any topic to apply the design on—it doesn’t have to make sense; you can even use Lorem Ipsum.

❓What about colors? 🤔
✅ We’ll pick different colors, but make sure they are harmonious with the images and with each other. There are many websites to help you with that, like:

And of course, I won’t leave you without some hints ☺:

1️⃣ It’s very important to use the alt attribute with your <img> tags for the reasons explained in the session.
2️⃣ Remember, for now, we agreed that you can’t use width and height together because there’s always a ratio between width and height called the aspect ratio.
So, what’s the solution to keep the design consistent? Use images that share the same aspect ratio. This website will help you:
